# Twitter Sentiment Analysis Application

---

This fun little project enables users to scrape Tweets
and perform sentiment analysis on them using exising Python Libraries.
This data can then be visualized and imported and exported to various formats.
In the future, programming my own sentiment analyzer would be a nice addition.
